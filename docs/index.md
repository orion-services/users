# Orion users documentation

Orion users is a small identity service intended for those who want to start a
prototype or project without the need to implement basic features like
managing and authenticating users.

Unlike feature-rich identity services like [keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org),
Orion Users is intended to provide a small and generic set of features that
developers can extends and customize freely.

Orion Users is written in [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io) through [reactive
programming](https://quarkus.io/guides/getting-started-reactive) and prepared to
run with [native compilation](https://quarkus.io/guides/building-native-image),
in other words, it is a code developed to run in cloud services with high
availability, low memory consumption (high density in clusters) and low
throughput.
